## About The Applied Artificial Intelligence Workshop
You already know you want to learn about AI and ML, and a smarter way to learn is to learn by doing. [The Applied Artificial Intelligence Workshop](https://courses.packtpub.com/courses/data-science?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838981266&utm_term=Data%20Science&utm_content=The%20Data%20Science%20Workshop) focuses on building up your practical skills to build intelligent games using Python or even build reliable decision tree models with modern AI and ML techniques. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results.

## What you will learn
* Create your first game in Python with the Minmax algorithm 
* Implement regression techniques to simplify real-world data 
* Experiment with classification techniques to label real-world data 
* Perform predictive analysis in Python using decision trees and random forests 
* Use clustering algorithms to group data without manual support  
* Learn how to use neural networks to process and classify labeled images
