To get started with the project files, you'll need to:
1. Setup [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

## About The Applied Artificial Intelligence Workshop
[The Applied Artificial Intelligence Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Artificial-Intelligence-Workshop-decision-ebook/dp/B08BZS3X9S/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the%20applied%20artificial%20intelligence%20workshop&qid=1610708393&sr=8-1&utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800205819&utm_term=Applied%20Aritificial%20Intelligence&utm_content=The%20Applied%20Aritificial%20Intelligence%20Workshop) teaches you the ins and outs of machine learning and neural networks from the ground up, using real-world examples. You'll learn to develop AI and ML models using Python, starting with using the minmax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning to create your first game, and ending with classifying images using neural networks.

## What you will learn
* Create your first AI game in Python with the minimax algorithm
* Implement regression techniques to simplify real-world data
* Experiment with classification techniques to label real-world data
* Perform predictive analysis in Python using decision trees and random forests
* Use clustering algorithms to group data without manual support 
* Understand how to use neural networks to process and classify labeled images
